# Data structures and algorithms

Implementations of various data structures and algorithms from scratch

Brush up on knowledge & serve as resource for later.

## Current listing
* Sorting: Insertion sort, Mergesort, Quicksort, Radix sort
* Graphs: Breadth first search, Depth first search
* Trees: Binary search tree
* Dynamic Programming: Top-down (memoization) and bottom-up 

## Hopeful additions
* Tries
* Balanced search trees (R-b tree, b-tree)
* Hashtables (implement hash function)
* ...and more!
