# Data structures and algorithms

Implementations of various data structures and algorithms from scratch

Brush up on knowledge & serve as resource for later...

## TODO:
* BFS, DFS
* Tries
* Balanced Search Tree (R-b tree, b-tree)
* Hashtables (Hash algorithm, open/closed hashing)
* Dynamic Programming
